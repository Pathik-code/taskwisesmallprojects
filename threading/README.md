# Threading Examples

This repository contains examples of threading implementations in Python, demonstrating various concepts of concurrent programming.

## Overview

The code demonstrates the following threading concepts:
- Basic thread creation and management
- Thread synchronization using locks
- Thread pools and worker threads
- Producer-Consumer pattern implementation
- Race condition handling

## Key Components

### Thread Creation Example
```python
import threading

def worker_function():
    # Thread work implementation
    pass

thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_function)
thread.start()
```

### Thread Pool Example
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_item(item):
    # Processing logic
    pass

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    executor.map(process_item, items)
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run individual examples:
   ```bash
   python thread_example.py
   ```

## Best Practices

- Always use thread-safe operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use thread pools for managing multiple threads
- Avoid sharing mutable state between threads
- Properly clean up thread resources

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required
