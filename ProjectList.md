## Projects List

### 1. Advanced File Search Engine
**Concepts:** Trie, Hashing, Graph Search (BFS/DFS), Regex
**Description:** Build a system to search files by their names, extensions, or metadata in directories. Implement a Trie for efficient prefix searching and graph algorithms for directory structure traversal.

### 2. Scalable Web Crawler
**Concepts:** Graph Algorithms, Multi-threading, Dynamic Programming
**Description:** Create a crawler to traverse websites, fetch data, and store it. Use BFS or DFS for link traversal and implement caching for previously visited URLs.

### 3. Data Compression and Encoding System
**Concepts:** Huffman Coding, Dynamic Programming
**Description:** Develop a system to compress data using algorithms like Huffman or Run-length encoding. Include functionalities to decompress the data as well.

### 4. Fraud Detection in Transactions
**Concepts:** Sliding Window, KMP/Rabin-Karp, Machine Learning
**Description:** Detect fraudulent transactions using pattern-matching algorithms for anomalies and ML integration for predictions.

### 5. Distributed Task Scheduling System
**Concepts:** Priority Queue (Heap), Graph (Topological Sort), Multi-threading
**Description:** Build a distributed scheduler to manage tasks with dependencies. Use heaps for priority-based scheduling and graphs to manage dependency resolution.

### 6. Code Auto-Completion
**Concepts:** Trie, N-grams, Probability Models
**Description:** Implement a system to suggest words or lines of code while typing. Use Trie for efficient lookups and N-grams for context-based suggestions.

### 7. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
**Concepts:** Sliding Window, Prefix Sums, Hash Maps
**Description:** Create a dashboard for streaming data analytics. Use sliding window for rolling averages and prefix sums for aggregated metrics.

### 8. Pathfinding Visualizer
**Concepts:** A*, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Heuristic-based Search
**Description:** Develop a visualizer to demonstrate pathfinding in a grid/graph. Implement A* or Dijkstra's algorithms for optimal route selection.

### 9. Multiplayer Game Server
**Concepts:** Graph Theory, Game Trees, Dynamic Programming
**Description:** Create a server to manage a multiplayer game. Use game trees for AI moves and dynamic programming for optimization.

### 10. Plagiarism Detection System
**Concepts:** Rabin-Karp, LCS, Hashing
**Description:** Design a tool to compare documents and detect plagiarized content using string-matching algorithms and hashing.

### 1. **System Health Monitor**
**Objective**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
**Details**:
- Create a script to fetch system stats using commands like `top`, `free`, and `df`.
- Log the data and send alerts via email or a notification system if thresholds are breached.
**Benefits**: Proactively track system health.

---

### 2. **Automated Backup Script**
**Objective**: Backup important files to a remote server or external drive.
**Details**:
- Use `rsync` or `tar` for backups.
- Add a cron job to run the script periodically.
**Benefits**: Automates data backup, preventing data loss.

---

### 3. **Log File Analyzer**
**Objective**: Extract meaningful information from logs (e.g., Apache, system logs).
**Details**:
- Parse logs using `awk`, `sed`, or `grep`.
- Generate a report summarizing errors or access patterns.
**Benefits**: Makes log analysis faster and more efficient.

---

### 4. **User Management Automation**
**Objective**: Create, modify, and manage users on a Linux system.
**Details**:
- Automate tasks like adding users (`useradd`), setting permissions, and managing groups.
- Include logging for all actions.
**Benefits**: Streamlines repetitive administrative tasks.

---

### 5. **Service Status Checker**
**Objective**: Check and report the status of critical services (e.g., Apache, MySQL).
**Details**:
- Use `systemctl` or `service` commands to verify if services are running.
- Notify via email or logs if any service is down.
**Benefits**: Ensures uptime of important services.

---

### 6. **Database Backup Script**
**Objective**: Backup MySQL/PostgreSQL databases.
**Details**:
- Use `mysqldump` or `pg_dump` to export database data.
- Compress the backups using `gzip` and transfer them to cloud storage.
**Benefits**: Safeguards critical database information.

---

### 7. **Scheduled Cleanup Script**
**Objective**: Clear old or unnecessary files from a directory.
**Details**:
- Identify files older than a certain age using `find`.
- Delete them and log the actions for review.
**Benefits**: Maintains a clean filesystem and prevents storage issues.

---

### 8. **Network Diagnostics Tool**
**Objective**: Diagnose network connectivity issues.
**Details**:
- Automate `ping`, `traceroute`, and `netstat` to check network health.
- Log results and alert if any anomalies are detected.
**Benefits**: Quickly identify and resolve network problems.

---

### 9. **Package Update and Upgrade Script**
**Objective**: Keep the system updated.
**Details**:
- Use `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf` commands to check for and apply updates.
- Schedule the script with cron and log the updates applied.
**Benefits**: Ensures the system stays secure and updated.

---

### 10. **Custom Command-Line Menu**
**Objective**: Create a menu-driven interface for common tasks.
**Details**:
- Design a script with options for tasks like service restarts, log checks, or backups.
- Use `select` or `case` for the menu structure.
**Benefits**: Provides a simplified interface for complex tasks.
